# Boost Range For Humans

Source code for [Boost Range For Humans][br4h], a website that has full,
self-contained example code for each function in [Boost Range][br].


### Building

Build requirements: libboost-all-dev gpp python3-jinja2

The documentation is built in Markdown format using a GNU Make.
Full build steps:

    make markdown

For more details about the available build options, run `make help`.


### Notes about the build process

Internally, the build process is complicated by the fact that range adaptors
have two different syntaxes: function call and pipe. To avoid
duplicate example code, these two variants are generated by [gpp][]
preprocessing of a common source file.

Apart from that, the build process is straight-forward: gpp-preprocess sources
– build – run and capture output – generate Markdown.
